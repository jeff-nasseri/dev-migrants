**Obtain your CBR health declaration**

You'll need to pay a â‚¬50 fee to obtain the health declaration certificate from CBR.nl.

**If you have a medical condition:**

If you declare any medical conditions or if the CBR determines additional assessment is needed, they will provide you with a ZD code (ZorgDomein code).

**Steps with a ZD code:**
- Schedule an appointment with a certified doctor
- Bring your ZD code to the appointment
- The doctor will evaluate your fitness to drive and automatically notify the CBR of their findings
- The CBR will then inform the RDW about your health status

Once approved, the RDW will proceed with issuing your Dutch driving license.
