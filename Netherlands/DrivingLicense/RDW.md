**Exchange Your Foreign Driving License in the Netherlands (30% Ruling Holders)**

If you're a highly skilled migrant relocating to the Netherlands with the 30% ruling, Dutch law allows you to exchange your foreign driving license for a Dutch one.

**Steps to Exchange Your License:**

**1. Schedule a municipality appointment**
Book an appointment with the municipality (gemeente) in the city where you're registered.

**2. Gather required documents**
Bring the following to your appointment:
- Valid passport
- Residence permit
- Proof of 30% ruling eligibility
- Your original foreign driving license
- Official translation of your driving license (certified by a sworn translator)

**3. Submit your application**
The municipality will process and forward your application to the RDW (Netherlands Vehicle Authority).

**4. Complete the health declaration**
After the RDW receives your application, you'll receive a letter requesting a CBR health declaration certificate. Follow the instructions in the letter to complete this requirement.
